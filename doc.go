// Package itertools contains methods that are helpful for working with iterators. Requires Golang version 1.23 or later. For more information on iterators see the [iter] package.
//
// The [maps] and [slices] packages already contain methods for converting slices and maps from/to iterators, so this package does not contain any methods to do this (although the [Reduce] method can be used to convert iterators into maps or slices if desired).
